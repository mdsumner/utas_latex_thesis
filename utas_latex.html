<b><a name="what">What is this?</a></b><br><br>

A style file is a way of getting LaTeX to do a lot of formatting and processing for tasks 

that are so common that they are deemed style file "worthy". The generation of a PhD thesis is

once such task that (in my opinion) falls into this category. Since the Research Higher Degrees 

Resource Book lays out fairly specific formatting guidelines for the thesis it becomes the task 

of the style file to automatically meet these formatting requirements. Basically then, we can 

visualise a style file in this instance as performing the appropriate formatting commands behind 

the scenes. The advantage of this approach is two fold: It enables easy alterations to the thesis 

as a whole and, more importantly, it frees the student from the sometimes troubling formatting 

problems that arise, allowing them to focus entirely on the contents of the thesis.

<br>

<br>

A template is, in this instance, a set of basic fundamental files that constitute the various 

elements of a thesis. These can be used as bare-bones starting points for populating the thesis 

with ideas. The template files include chapters, appendices, bibliography etc. To make a thesis 

from the template all one needs to do is edit the appropriate files with one's own content and 

the overall structure should already be in place.

<b><a name="notwhat">What this isn't.</a></b><br><br>

This is not a tutorial on how to use LaTeX. There are many fine references on the net that address 

this issue. A good place to start is <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/?action=/tex-archive/info/lshort/">"The (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX2e"</a> 

which is not only a good introduction but also serves as a handy reference manual . Thus in the following 

discussion I assume that you know what LaTeX is 

and how to use it on your operating system of choice. I also assume you know how to install packages (add-ons 

for LaTeX that increase its functionality) since the thesis style file is dependent on a few packages for

fancy effects...no point reinventing the wheel.

<li>

<b><a name="who">Who can use it?</a></b><br><br>

This style file is designed primarily for students of mathematics at UTas who are undertaking a PhD.

However, only very minor changes need to be made to the wording in a few places to use it as a template for an 

honours or Masters thesis as well. In fact, there is no particular reason why this could be not used for, say, an Arts thesis (Shock, Horror!) since

it is mainly about the formatting and less about the content. However, the heading and chapter structure has been chosen

so as to be more in line with standard practice in the scientific streams. Again, if you know what you're doing then it's really 

not that difficult to modify the style file at the appropriate places. I have tried to comment it quite heavily so that interested 

persons can see how it does all its work and, hopefully, make changes that reflect personal tastes etc. 

Okay, if you're still with me then read on...

<li>

<b><a name="how">How do you use it?</a></b><br><br>

Follow the steps below to set your computer up to use the thesis style file and templates.

<br>

<br>

<ol>

<li><b><a name="#how1">Get the required packages</a></b><br><br>

You must ensure that your LaTeX installation has the following packages installed.

<ul>

<li> 'graphicx' for graphics manipulation </li>

<li> 'makeidx' for generating the index </li>

<li> 'fancyhdr' for nice headers and footers. </li>

<li> 'tocbibind' for adding table of contents entries for bibliography, index etc. </li>

<li> 'sectsty' for generating stylised chapter and section headings. </li>

</ul>

<br>I believe the first two are part of any standard LaTeX installation but unless you have a complete 

installation with all packages the remaining three will have to be obtained. This is easy enough to do. 

Just go to  <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a> and grab the ones that are listed above and follow their self install 

directions for your particular OS.

<br>&nbsp;</li> 





<li><b><a name="#how2">Download the thesis files</a></b><br><br>

You must download the following files and save them all to the same directory on your computer

<br>

<br>

<ul>

<li> The thesis style file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/mathphdthesis.sty">mathphdthesis.sty</a> </li>

<li> The thesis TeX file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/thesis.tex">thesis.tex</a> </li>

<li> The prelude TeX file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/prelude.tex">prelude.tex</a> </li>

<li> The new commands TeX file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/newcom.tex">newcom.tex</a></li>

<li> The chapter TeX files <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/chap1.tex">chap1.tex</a>, <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/chap2.tex">chap2.tex</a>, 

<a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/chap3.tex">chap3.tex</a> and <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/chap4.tex">chap4.tex</a></li>

<li> The appendix switch TeX file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/app0.tex">app0.tex</a> </li>

<li> The appendix TeX files <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/app1.tex">app1.tex</a> and <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/app2.tex">app2.tex</a> </li>

<li> The bibliography switch TeX file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/biby.tex">biby.tex</a> </li>

<li> The sample bibliography database <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/thesis.bib">thesis.bib</a> </li>

<li> The index switch TeX file <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/index.tex">index.tex</a> </li>

<li> The UTas graphics logo <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/Utas_vert_BW.ps">Utas_vert_BW.ps</a> </li>

</ul>

<br>

If you prefer, you can just download the zip archive <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/thesis.zip">thesis.zip</a> which 

contains all the files listed above as well as the dvi and pdf versions of the bare bones thesis that you will generate in 

the next section.

<br>

[<a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/#top">Back to the top</a>]

<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b><a name="#how3">Test the bare-bones files</a></b><br><br>

Now that you have all the files in one directory with all the relevant packages installed you can 

make the bare bones thesis by running LaTeX on the file 'thesis.tex'. In order for LaTeX to determine the 

page numbers correctly in the table of contents you have to execute the commands in the following order.

<br>

<br>

<ul>

<li> Run LaTeX on thesis.tex </li>

<li> Run BIBTex on thesis.tex </li>

<li> Run MakeIndex on thesis.idx (note the different file extension) </li>

<li> Run LaTeX again on thesis.tex </li>

<li> Run LaTeX once more on thesis.tex </li>

</ul>

<br>

This may look a little strange but this sequence of commands is necessary to make sure LaTeX gets all its page numbers and

references correct. If you are interested in why this is so, read up on how LaTeX generates its table of contents, bibliography 

and index.

<br>

<br>

Now look at the dvi file that is produced. It should look like this <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/thesis.dvi">thesis.dvi</a> 

(or the pdf version <a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/thesis.pdf">thesis.pdf</a>). If it does, then all that's left to do is to read the next 

section to find out how to customise your name, abstract etc. for inclusion in the thesis.

<br>

<br>

If it doesn't work I would guess something wrong with the LaTeX processing step so try repeating the commands above. 

It's also possible that your package installation went awry so perhaps reinstall (?). Other than that, your guess is as 

good as mine. You can try emailing me (see below) but I don't guarantee any form of dedicated technical support. 

I can only offer advice and suggestions etc.

<br>

[<a href="http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~mdsumner/TCallaghan/#top">Back to the top</a>]

<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b><a name="#how4">Customise the template</a></b><br><br>

Now that you have a working bare-bones thesis you can modify the parts that will customise it for 

you personally. The file that you will need to edit is 'prelude.tex'. If you have a look in this file you will see 

the following lines...

<p>

<code>

\title{PLACE THESIS TITLE HERE} % use all capital letters<br>

\author{Your Name} % use mixed upper &amp; lower case<br>

\prevdegrees{B.A. B.Sc. Hons (Qld)} % Used to specify your previous degrees...use mixed upper &amp; lower case<br>

\advisor{Dr Ask Me} % example: Professor Lawrence K. Forbes<br>

\dept{Mathematics} % your academic department<br>

\submitdate{August, 2004} % month &amp; year of your thesis submission<br>

</code>

</p>

Just simply change your relevant details in the fields. For example, if your name was John Smith B.A. Hons (QUT) and 

you were studying Ship Hydrodynamics you would put

<p>

<code>

\title{SHIP HYDRODYNAMICS} % use all capital letters<br>

\author{John Smith} % use mixed upper &amp; lower case<br>

\prevdegrees{B.A. Hons (QUT)} % Used to specify your previous degrees...use mixed upper &amp; lower case<br>

\advisor{Dr Ask Me} % example: Professor Lawrence K. Forbes<br>

\dept{Mathematics} % your academic department<br>

\submitdate{August, 2004} % month &amp; year of your thesis submission<br>

</code>

</p>

Now change the abstract and acknowledgements text by altering the text between the {} braces after the commands 

<code>\newcommand{\abstextwithesis}</code> and <code>\newcommand{\acknowledgement}</code>.

<p>

Look at the very top of the file 'prelude.tex'. You will see a lot of commands with 'true' contained at the end of 

the command name. These are actually flags that specify which elements of the preface you want to generate. By default all 

the commands are set to true (include everything) but if you don't want to include something you merely change the 'true' to 

'false' at the end of the command name. For example, to not include the title page you would change <code>\titlepgtrue</code> 

to <code>\titlepgfalse</code>. This is actually a handy thing to do since the title page contains the University logo on it 

and this causes a delay in display refresh times when viewing the dvi file since the image has to load each time. If your computer 

is slow-ish you probably want to set the above command to false to leave it out until you want to print a rough draft etc.

</p>

<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b><a name="#how5">Populate the Thesis pages with original ideas!</a></b><br><br>

The easy part, or the hard part, depending on what we are talking about. From here all that remains to do is to 

fill out the chapters with your own work. You edit the chapters as you would any normal LaTeX document by placing your text 

and markup commands inside a chapter declaration. See the files 'chap1.tex', 'chap2.tex' etc. for examples. You can also add more 

packages to the preamble (after the documentclass declaration) to extend the functionality of LaTeX even more but you should always 

be careful of nullifying the formats that are set up in the style file. To make sure your commands are local you should always 

declare them inside an environment (inside {} braces). 

<p>

A sample bibliography database has also been included to give you an idea of how to set one up. See the BibTeX manual for more 

help on this topic. In addition, appendices have been added but these can be removed if needs been by simply commenting the 

appropriate include statements out in 'thesis.tex'.

</p>

Perhaps this is not the best way to produce a thesis but it's a reasonable start and hopefully over time we can all make suggestions 

about what this style file should include so that the department has a quality style file that can be used by all students. For this 

reason suggestions and comments are most welcome and should be forwarded to me by way of the contact below.

<h4><a name="acknow">Acknowledgements</a></h4>

I obtained the information to make this file from a variety of sources on the internet. In particular I have drawn 

on the work of <a href="http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/help/uithesis/index.html">John Castelloe</a>. I 

have used his templating system as it is the obvious way to do things neatly. I have also used some 

of his code for populating dynamic content.

<br>I don't pretend to take credit for originality, however the general code design has been altered 

enough so as to justifiably call it my own...sort of ;)
